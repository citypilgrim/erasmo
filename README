#+TITLE: Erasmo

An attempt of a =~/.dotfiles=, inspired by the amazing [[https://github.com/abcdw/rde][RDE]], yet retaining my =.emacs.d=. This repository records my journey as I delve deeper into a full GNU environment.

* Goals
- Stage 1 :: ~guix home~ services set up
  + [ ] shells configured
  + [ ] ~gpg~ configured
  + [ ] ~ssh~ configured
  + [ ] managing all packages
  + [ ] managing packages for ~emacs~
  + [ ] cloning and deploying ~emacs~ configuration
  + [ ] ~guix~ channel locking
- Stage 2 :: incorporating ~rde~
  + [ ] emacs configuration
  + [ ] all other features
- Stage 3 :: ~guix system~ set up

* Usage (via =examples=)
1. Place environment variables in =~/.env=
2. Generate a ~guix~ binary based on =erasmo/channels-lock.scm= by calling ~make -B target/profiles/guix~
3. Run the following
   #+begin_src sh
     cd examples
     make default/home/reconfigure
   #+end_src
4. If you would like to configure ~emacs~, manually clone/symlink your emacs configurations

* External Setup
Unfortunately, certain things are not packaged in guix. For which we have to install manually.

- ~diatheke~ ;SWORD module integration
- ~gradle~ ;building tool
- ~jdk~; whatever is required by the project
